       "\"<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking for the capital of Bangladesh. Let me think. I remember that Bangladesh is a country in South Asia. The capital is a city that I've heard of, maybe Dhaka? Wait, isn't Dhaka also the largest city there? I think so. But I should double-check to make sure I'm not confusing it with another country. Let me recall: countries in that region, like India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. Their capitals are New Delhi, Islamabad, Kathmandu, Thimphu, and Dhaka respectively. Yes, that's right. So the capital of Bangladesh is Dhaka. I should also mention that Dhaka is not only the capital but also the largest city in Bangladesh. Maybe add a bit about its significance, like it being the political, cultural, and economic hub. Also, maybe note the population or when it became the capital. Wait, did Dhaka become the capital when Bangladesh gained independence? Or was it a different city before? I think before 1971, when Bangladesh was East Pakistan, the capital was Dhaka as well, but under Pakistani rule. After independence in 1971, it remained the capital. So the answer is Dhaka, with some context about its role in the country. Let me make sure there's no confusion with other cities. Sometimes people might mix up cities in similar regions, but Dhaka is distinct. I can confirm this by checking a quick source if needed, but from my knowledge, this should be correct.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of Bangladesh is **Dhaka**. \\n\\n**Key Details:**\\n- **Dhaka** is not only the capital but also the largest and most populous city in Bangladesh.\\n- It serves as the country's political, economic, and cultural hub.\\n- The city has a rich history, having been established in the 7th century and later becoming the capital of British Bengal in 1704.\\n- After Bangladesh gained independence in 1971, Dhaka remained the capital. It is home to landmarks like the **Liberation War Museum** and the **National Parliament Building**.\\n\\nLet me know if you'd like additional information! 🇧🇩\""
